Render Version is currently running on a mix of 1.1 and 1.0

It will be updated after the release of either 1.5 or 1.6, worst case 2.0 but thats too unlikely. 

Currently not recommended for use


PS: start.bat is converted to start.sh by Deepseek AI because I don't use either Linux or MacOS nor do I know their languages
