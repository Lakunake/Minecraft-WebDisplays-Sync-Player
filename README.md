Render Version is currently running on a mix of 1.1 and 1.0

It will be updated after the release of either 1.5 or 1.6, worst case 2.0 but thats too unlikely. 

Currently not recommended for use, although you can theoritically use the start.sh instead of the start.bat file on almost every version of the repo without any problems.

See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for license details

PS: start.bat is converted to start.sh by Deepseek AI because I don't use either Linux or MacOS nor do I know their languages.
